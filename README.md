# Survey/Review

### 软件漏洞自动利用研究进展

* <img src="image/pdf_24px.png">[Paper](./paper/2016软件漏洞自动利用研究进展.pdf)

**Abstract:** 软件漏洞发掘是当前的热点问题。尽管模糊测试技术帮助我们解决了程序漏洞的自动发现问题，并行模糊测试平台已经可以高效的发现大量的程序错误，但无论是防御者还是攻击者，都更关心这些程序漏洞或错误是否可能被利用。如何快速分析、评估漏洞的可利用性是当前漏洞发掘与分析的关键问题之一。传统软件漏洞利用主要以手工方式构造，该过程不仅需要具备较为全面的系统底层知识（包括文件格式，汇编代码，操作系统内部机理以及处理器架构等），同时还需要对漏洞机理深入、细致的分析，才可能构造成功的利用。目前，随着程序分析技术的不断发展，尤其是污点分析、符号执行等技术成功运用在软件动态分析以及软件漏洞挖掘等多个领域后，研究者开始尝试利用这些技术来进行高效的软件漏洞利用自动构造。

### EXPRACE: Exploiting Kernel Races through Raising Interrupts

* <img src="image/pdf_24px.png">[Paper](./paper/2021EXPRACE%20Exploiting%20Kernel%20Races%20through%20Raising%20Interrupts.pdf)

**Abstract:** A kernel data race is notoriously challenging to detect, reproduce, and diagnose, mainly caused by nondeterministic thread interleaving. The kernel data race has a critical security implication since it often leads to memory corruption, which can be abused to launch privilege escalation attacks. Interestingly, due to the challenges above, the exploitation of the kernel data race is also challenging. Specifically, we find that some kernel races are nearly impossible to exploit due to their unique requirement on execution orders, which are almost impossible to happen without manual intervention.    
<p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">This paper develops a generic exploitation technique for kernel data races. To this end, we first analyze kernel data races, which finds an intrinsic condition classifying easy-to-exploit and hard-to-exploit races. Then we develop EXPRACE, a generic race exploitation technique for modern kernels, including Linux, Microsoft Windows, and MAC OS X. EXPRACE turns hard-to-exploit races into easy-toexploit races by manipulating an interrupt mechanism during the exploitation. According to our evaluation with 10 realworld hard-to-exploit races, EXPRACE was able to exploit all of those within 10 to 118 seconds, while an exploitation without EXPRACE failed for all given 24 hours.</p>

### A Generic Technique for Automatically Finding Defense-Aware Code Reuse Attacks

* <img src="image/pdf_24px.png">[Paper](./paper/2020A%20Generic%20Technique%20for%20Automatically%20Finding%20Defense-Aware%20Code%20Reuse%20Attacks.pdf)

**Abstract:** Code reuse attacks have been the subject of a substantial amount of research during the past decade. This research largely resulted from early work on Return-Oriented Programming (ROP), which showed that the then newly proposed Non-Executable Memory (NX) defense could be bypassed. More recently, the research community has been simultaneously investigating new defenses that are believed
to thwart code reuse attacks, such as Control Flow Integrity (CFI), and defense-aware techniques for attacking these defenses, such as Data-Oriented Programming (DOP). Unfortunately, the feasibility of defense-aware attacks are very dependent on the behaviors of the attacked program, which makes it difficult for defenders to understand how much protection a defense such as CFI may provide. To better understand this, researchers have introduced automated defense-aware code reuse attack systems. Unfortunately, the handful of existing systems implement a single fixed, defense-specific strategy that is complex and cannot be used to consider other defenses.   
In this paper, we propose a generic framework for automatically discovering defense-aware code reuse attacks in executables. Unlike existing work, which utilizes hard-coded strategies for specific defenses, our framework can produce attacks for multiple defenses by analyzing the runtime behavior of the defense. The high-level insight behind our framework is that code reuse attacks can be defined as a state reachability problem, and that defenses prevent some transitions between states.We implement our framework as a tool named Limbo, which employs an existing binary concolic executor to solve the reachability problem.We evaluate Limbo and show that it excels when there is little code available for reuse, making it complementary to existing techniques.We show that, in such scenarios, Limbo outperforms existing systems that automate ROP attacks, as well as systems that automate DOP attacks in the presence of fine-grained CFI, despite having no special knowledge about ROP or DOP attacks.

### A Pattern-Based Software Testing Framework for Exploitability Evaluation of Metadata Corruption Vulnerabilities

* <img src="image/pdf_24px.png">[Paper](./paper/2020A%20Pattern-Based%20Software%20Testing%20Framework%20for%20Exploitability%20Evaluation%20of%20Metadata%20Corruption%20Vulnerabilities.pdf)

**Abstract:** In recent years, increased attention is being given to software quality assurance and protection. With considerable verification and protection schemes proposed and deployed, today’s software unfortunately still fails to be protected from cyberattacks, especially in the presence of insecure organization of heap metadata. In this paper, we aim to explore whether heap metadata could be corrupted and exploited by cyberattackers, in an attempt to assess the exploitability of vulnerabilities and ensure software quality. To this end, we propose RELAY, a software testing framework to simulate human exploitation behavior for metadata corruption at the machine level. RELAY employs the heap layout serialization method to construct exploit patterns from human expertise and decomposes complex exploit-solving problems into a series of intermediate state-solving subproblems. With the heap layout procedural method, RELAY makes use of the fewer resources consumed to solve a layout problem according to the exploit pattern, activates the intermediate state, and generates the final exploit. Additionally, RELAY can be easily extended and can continuously assimilate human knowledge to enhance its ability for exploitability evaluation. Using 20 CTF&RHG programs, we then demonstrate that RELAY has the ability to evaluate the exploitability of metadata corruption vulnerabilities and works more efficiently compared with other state-of-the-art automated tools.

### A Systematic Study of Elastic Objects in Kernel Exploitation

* <img src="image/pdf_24px.png">[Paper](./paper/2020A%20Systematic%20Study%20of%20Elastic%20Objects%20in%20Kernel%20Exploitation.pdf)

**Abstract:** Recent research has proposed various methods to perform kernel exploitation and bypass kernel protection. For example, security researchers have demonstrated an exploitation method that utilizes the characteristic of elastic kernel objects to bypass KASLR, disclose stack/heap cookies, and even perform arbitrary read in the kernel. While this exploitation method is considered a commonly adopted approach to disclosing critical kernel information, there is no evidence indicating a strong need for developing a new defense mechanism to limit this exploitation method. It is because the effectiveness of this exploitation method is demonstrated only on anecdotal kernel vulnerabilities. It is unclear whether such a method is useful for a majority of kernel vulnerabilities.    
To answer this question, we propose a systematic approach. It utilizes static/dynamic analysis methods to pinpoint elastic kernel objects and then employs constraint solving to pair them to corresponding kernel vulnerabilities. In this work, we implement our proposed method as a tool - ELOISE. Using this tool on three popular OSes (Linux, FreeBSD, and XNU), we discover that elastic objects are pervasive in general caches. Evaluating the effectiveness of these elastic objects on 40 kernel vulnerabilities across three OSes, we observe that they can enable most of the vulnerabilities to bypass KASLR and heap cookie protector. Besides, we also observe that these elastic objects can even escalate the exploitability of some vulnerabilities allowing them to perform arbitrary read in the kernel. Motivated by these observations, we further introduce a new defense mechanism to mitigate the threat of elastic kernel objects. We prototype our defense mechanism on Linux, showing this mechanism introduces negligible overhead.

### AURORA: Statistical Crash Analysis for Automated Root Cause Explanation

* <img src="image/pdf_24px.png">[Paper](./paper/2020AURORA%20Statistical%20Crash%20Analysis%20for%20Automated%20Root%20Cause%20Explanation.pdf)

**Abstract:** Given the huge success of automated software testing techniques, a large amount of crashes is found in practice. Identifying the root cause of a crash is a time-intensive endeavor, causing a disproportion between finding a crash and fixing the underlying software fault. To address this problem, various approaches have been proposed that rely on techniques such as reverse execution and backward taint analysis. Still, these techniques are either limited to certain fault types or provide an analyst with assembly instructions, but no context information or explanation of the underlying fault.   
In this paper, we propose an automated analysis approach that does not only identify the root cause of a given crashing input for a binary executable, but also provides the analyst with context information on the erroneous behavior that characterizes crashing inputs. Starting with a single crashing input, we generate a diverse set of similar inputs that either also crash the program or induce benign behavior. We then trace the program’s states while executing each found input and generate predicates, i. e., simple Boolean expressions that capture behavioral differences between crashing and noncrashing inputs. A statistical analysis of all predicates allows us to identify the predicate pinpointing the root cause, thereby not only revealing the location of the root cause, but also providing an analyst with an explanation of the misbehavior a crash exhibits at this location. We implement our approach in a tool called AURORA and evaluate it on 25 diverse software faults. Our evaluation shows that AURORA is able to uncover root causes even for complex bugs. For example, it succeeded in cases where many millions of instructions were executed between developer fix and crashing location. In contrast to existing approaches, AURORA is also able to handle bugs with no data dependency between root cause and crash, such as type confusion bugs.

### Automatic Techniques to Systematically Discover New Heap Exploitation Primitives

* <img src="image/pdf_24px.png">[Paper](./paper/2020Automatic%20Techniques%20to%20Systematically%20Discover%20New%20Heap%20Exploitation%20Primitives.pdf)

**Abstract:** Exploitation techniques to abuse the metadata of heap allocators have been widely studied because of their generality (i.e., application independent) and powerful capability (i.e., bypassing mitigation). However, such techniques are commonly considered arts, and thus the approaches to discover them remain ad-hoc, manual, and allocator-specific at best.   
In this paper, we present an automatic tool, ARCHEAP, to systematically discover the unexplored heap exploitation primitives, regardless of their underlying implementations. The key idea of ARCHEAP is to let the computer autonomously explore the spaces, similar in concept to fuzzing, by specifying a set of common designs of modern heap allocators and root causes of vulnerabilities
as models, and by providing heap operations and attack capabilities as actions. During the exploration, ARCHEAP checks whether the combinations of these actions can be potentially used to construct exploitation primitives, such as arbitrary write or overlapped chunks. As a proof, ARCHEAP generates working PoC that demonstrates the discovered exploitation technique.   
We evaluated ARCHEAP with three real-world allocators (i.e., ptmalloc, tcmalloc, and jemalloc), as well as custom allocators from the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge. As a result, ARCHEAP discovered five previously unknown exploitation primitives in ptmalloc and found several exploitation techniques against jemalloc, tcmalloc, and even custom heap allocators. To show the effectiveness of ARCHEAP’s approach in other domains, we also studied how security features evolve and which exploit primitives are effective across different versions of ptmalloc.

* <img src="image/pdf_24px.png">[Paper](./paper/2020Autosploit%20A%20Fully%20Automated%20Framework%20for%20Evaluating.pdf)

**Abstract:** The existence of a security vulnerability in a system does not necessarily mean that it can be exploited. In this research, we introduce Autosploit —an automated framework for evaluating the exploitability of vulnerabilities. Given a vulnerable environment and relevant exploits, Autosploit will automatically test the exploits on different configurations of the environment in order to identify the specific properties necessary for successful exploitation of the existing vulnerabilities. Since testing all possible system configurations is infeasible, we introduce an efficient approach for testing and searching through all possible configurations of the environment. The efficient testing process implemented by Autosploit is based on two algorithms: generalized binary splitting and Barinel, which are used for noiseless and noisy environments respectively. We implemented the proposed framework and evaluated it using real vulnerabilities. The results show that Autosploit is able to automatically identify the system properties that affect the ability to exploit a vulnerability in both noiseless and noisy environments. These important results can be utilized for more accurate and effective risk assessment.

### Guide Me to Exploit: Assisted ROP Exploit Generation for ActionScript Virtual Machine

* <img src="image/pdf_24px.png">[Paper](./paper/2020Guide%20Me%20to%20Exploit%20Assisted%20ROP%20Exploit%20Generation%20for%20ActionScript%20Virtual%20Machine.pdf)

**Abstract:** Automatic exploit generation (AEG) is the challenge of determining the exploitability of a given vulnerability by exploring all possible execution paths that can result from triggering the vulnerability. Since typical AEG implementations might need to explore an unbounded number of execution paths, they usually utilize a fuzz tester and a symbolic execution tool to facilitate this task. However, in the case of language virtual machines, such as the ActionScript Virtual Machine (AVM), AEG implementations cannot leverage fuzz testers or symbolic execution tools for generating the exploit script, because of two reasons: (1) fuzz testers cannot efficiently generate grammatically correct executables for the AVM due to the improbability of randomly generating highly-structured executables that follow the complex grammar rules and (2) symbolic execution tools encounter the well-known program-state-explosion problem due to the enormous number of control paths in early processing stages of a language virtual machine (e.g., lexing and parsing).   
This paper presents GuidExp, a guided (semi-automatic) exploit generation tool for AVM vulnerabilities. GuidExp synthesizes an exploit script that exploits a given ActionScript vulnerability. Unlike other AEG implementations, GuidExp leverages exploit deconstruction, a technique of splitting the exploit script into many smaller code snippets. GuidExp receives hints from security experts and uses them to determine places where the exploit script can be split. Thus, GuidExp can concentrate on synthesizing these smaller code snippets in sequence to obtain the exploit script instead of synthesizing the entire exploit script at once. GuidExp does not rely on fuzz testers or symbolic execution tools. Instead, GuidExp performs exhaustive search adopting four optimization techniques to facilitate the AEG process: (1) exploit deconstruction, (2) operand stack verification, (3) instruction tiling, and (4) feedback from the AVM. A running example highlights how GuidExp synthesizes the exploit script for a real-world AVM use-after-free vulnerability. In addition, GuidExp’s successful generation of exploits for ten other AVM vulnerabilities is reported.

### HAEPG: An Automatic Multi-hop Exploitation Generation Framework

* <img src="image/pdf_24px.png">[Paper](./paper/2020HAEPG%20An%20Automatic%20Multi-hop%20Exploitation%20Generation%20Framework.pdf)

**Abstract:** Automatic exploit generation for heap vulnerabilities is an open challenge. Current studies require a sensitive pointer on the heap to hijack the control flow and pay little attention to vulnerabilities with limited capabilities. In this paper, we propose HAEPG, an automatic exploit framework that can utilize known exploitation techniques to guide exploit generation. We implemented a prototype of HAEPG based on the symbolic execution engine S2E and provided four exploitation techniques for it as prior knowledge. HAEPG takes crashing inputs, programs, and prior knowledge as input, and generates exploits for vulnerabilities with limited capabilities by abusing heap allocator’s internal functionalities.   
We evaluated HAEPG with 24 CTF programs, and the results show that HAEPG is able to accurately reason about the type of vulnerability for 21 (87.5%) of them, and generate exploits that spawn a shell for 16 (66.7%) of them. All the exploits could bypass NX and Full RELRO security mechanisms.

### HS-Pilot: Heap Security Evaluation Tool Model Based on Atomic Heap Interaction

* <img src="image/pdf_24px.png">[Paper](./paper/2020HS-Pilot%20Heap%20Security%20Evaluation%20Tool%20Model%20Based%20on%20Atomic%20Heap%20Interaction.pdf)

**Abstract:** To evaluate heap security, researchers have designed evaluation tools that automatically locate heap vulnerabilities. Most of these tools define heap interactions as heap misuses that are bugs, such as overflow in a target heap allocator, and verify whether each combination of heap interactions can be used as an exploit. However, this definition of heap interactions requires preliminary work by a user possessing evaluation tools and specialized knowledge—the user needs to manually do much work to find which heap misuses exist in the target heap allocator. In addition, because the existing heap misuses vary according to target heap allocators and versions, this preliminary work must be performed on each heap implementation. That is, the current definition of heap interaction cannot be generalized to all heap implementations.   
In this paper, we propose a novel heap security evaluation model, called Heap Security Pilot (HS-Pilot), to overcome the preliminary work load and the dependency of heap misuse in heap implementation. In HSPilot, a heap interaction is newly defined as the modification of heap metadata, based on the idea that any heap misuse can be represented by a sequence of heap metadata, i.e. combination of heap interactions used by HS-Pilot. Consequently, the heap interactions in HS-Pilot can be applied to all heap implementations without specialized knowledge, and therefore, are more general than that in existing heap evaluation tools. Our evaluation shows that HS-Pilot can cover the analysis range of other evaluation tools, and is able to detect 14 known types of heap exploitation against heap allocator ptmalloc and all types of heap exploitation found by a state-of-the-art evaluation tool.

### KOOBE: Towards Facilitating Exploit Generation of Kernel Out-Of-Bounds Write Vulnerabilities

* <img src="image/pdf_24px.png">[Paper](./paper/2020KOOBE%20Towards%20Facilitating%20Exploit%20Generation%20of%20Kernel%20Out-Of-Bounds%20Write%20Vulnerabilities.pdf)

**Abstract:** The monolithic nature of modern OS kernels leads to a constant stream of bugs being discovered. It is often unclear
which of these bugs are worth fixing, as only a subset of them may be serious enough to lead to security takeovers (i.e., privilege
escalations). Therefore, researchers have recently started to develop automated exploit generation techniques (for UAF bugs) to assist the bug triage process. In this paper, we investigate another top memory vulnerability in Linux kernel -- out-of-bounds (OOB) memory write from heap. We design KOOBE to assist the analysis of such vulnerabilities based on two observations: (1) Surprisingly often, different OOB vulnerability instances exhibit a wide range of capabilities. (2) Kernel exploits are multi-interaction in nature (i.e., multiple syscalls are involved in an exploit) which allows the exploit crafting process to be modular. Specifically, we focus on the extraction of capabilities of an OOB vulnerability which will feed the subsequent exploitability evaluation process.
Our system builds on several building blocks, including a novel capability-guided fuzzing solution to uncover hidden capabilities, and a way to compose capabilities together to further enhance the likelihood of successful exploitations. In our evaluation, we demonstrate the applicability of KOOBE by exhaustively analyzing 17 most recent Linux kernel OOB vulnerabilities (where only 5 of them have publicly available exploits), for which KOOBE successfully generated candidate exploit strategies for 11 of them (including 5 that do not even have any CVEs assigned). Subsequently from these strategies, we are able to construct fully working exploits for all of them.

### Analysis to Heap Overflow Exploit in Linux with Symbolic Execution

* <img src="image/pdf_24px.png">[Paper](./paper/2019Analysis%20to%20Heap%20Overflow%20Exploit%20in%20Linux%20with%20Symbolic.pdf)

**Abstract:** Heap overflow is a common error of buffer overflow in Linux. The control flow of a program may be hijacked when the program satisfies several specific conditions. The existing automatic exploit generation technologies for buffer overflow find vulnerability trigger point and generate exploit by checking the control flow state. However, the heap overflow data rarely lead to a control flow hijacking as well as protection mechanisms limit the trigger condition. It is difficult to analyze the exploitability of heap overflow automatically through the existing analysis technology. For the heap overflow errors in Linux, we summarize the features of exploit on the basis of analyzing the instances, building the detection model of the exploitability of heap overflow, and proposing a method for analyzing the exploitability of heap overflow based on the model. The proposed method monitors the input data and insecurity functions of the program by using taint analysis; builds the path constraints and data constraints which satisfy the conditions of heap overflow exploit through selective symbolic execution; solves the abovementioned constraints and generates the test case automatically. All the steps of our method can be finished automatically by using the symbolic execution tool S2E. The experiments show that this method can automatically analyze and detect the exploitability of heap overflow errors.
